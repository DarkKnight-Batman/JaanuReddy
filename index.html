        <h1>Dear Meena</h1>
        <p>
            They say the sun shines brightest in the morning, but it doesn’t compare to how your laughter lights up a room. 
            You’re like a good cup of coffee—warm, energizing, and impossible to forget.
        </p>
        <p>
            A rose feels like a small offering for someone who’s as unique as a perfectly timed joke. Your words are like 
            the twist in a story—unexpected and always leaving people wanting more.
        </p>
        <p>
            If this letter finds its way to you, I hope it brings a smile, like the ones you seem to hand out effortlessly. 
            And if not, well, at least this rose can enjoy being near someone it could never outshine.
        </p>
        <p>Yours, <br> A hopeful storyteller with a rose.</p>
